Q10 -> 	We scan the product list twice. 
	Once to print all products.
	Second time to let buyer select product.
Location: menu.cpp

C'tors -> In classes which have dynamic fields, we initialized
	these fields with nullptr for the setters.
	Our setters delete the field to make sure no memory is lost
	in case of setters being used to change an existing value.
	When the c'tor calls the setters, if the fields are not initialized,
	then the program would crash.
