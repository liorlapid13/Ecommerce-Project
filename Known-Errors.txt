# Known Errors File

Question 10 -> 	We scan the product list twice. 
	Once to print all products.
	Second time to let buyer select product.
Location: menu.cpp

C'tors -> In classes which have dynamic fields, we initialized
	these fields with nullptr for the setters.
	Our setters delete the field to make sure no memory is lost
	in case of setters being used to change an existing value.
	When the c'tor calls the setters, if the fields are not initialized,
	then the program would crash.

Input Parameters -> In the constructors, we call setter methods which have
	input checks that only create objects if all fields meet the requirements.
	Therefore if any field is entered incorectly then the object will not
	be created but the program will not exit. We require correct inputs
	in order for the program to work correctly.
	All prerequisites are mentioned in the detailed user guide located in the README file.

Input Parameters -> When receiving an input from user for parameters,
		we set a static max-length for each parameter.
		As instructed by our Professors, 
		we assume that the user does not input anything longer than
		the set max-length.
		For example: username, password, product name, etc...
